This is the repository for research I conducted with Professor Junpei Komiyama at NYU Stern. 

This repo contains code with applications to
- Ride-hailing simulations
- Traffic prediction
- Uber fare prediction
- Dynamic matching

In each folder are several iterations of each simulation. These include features and techniques such as
- "City simulating" graph generation
- Event-driven data population in continuous time
- Offline benchmarking and optimization
- Convergent cross-mapping for fare prediction 

This also includes work-in-progress code for 
- Graph WaveNets for traffic prediction
